-1. Don't get me wrong 别误会我

-2. You have my word 我保证

-3. Can I take a rain check? 你可以改天嘛？

-4. Hang on a sec 等一下

-5. I'll give it a shot 我试试看

-6. I'm gonna do

-7. finna
"Finna" is an abbreviation for the phrase "fixing to." It is essentially used in place of the more common (and the more easily understandable) "gonna," which is short for "going to." If you're finna do something, you're going to or planning on doing it.

-8. So we cool? Are we cool?
“我们之间没什么问题吧？”或者“你没有生我气吧？”

当跟朋友起了冲突，等到冷静下来之后，可以用这句话来破冰哦~ 如果没什么问题，可以回答一句"Yeah, we are cool." 表示“没事，我没问题。”

-9.  在你刚理解了某种新信息，或者刚学会做某个新事情的时候，外国朋友通常都会用这句话来鼓励你。来看下例句：

- Is this how it's done?

是这样做吗？

- Yeah, there you go.

哎哟，不错哦。

-10. - It's not my fault that we're late.

我们迟到了可不怪我。

- Don't give me that! You were the one who said we didn't have to leave early!

少来这套！是你说我们不用早点出发的！

-11. You never can tell 代表“这可说不准”的意思。

如果你想表达“不可以告诉任何人”，应该说You can't tell any one.

-12. Where were we可不是在问“我们在哪”！

"Where were we?" 这句话单独出现、没跟任何时间点的时候，它其实表示的是：“我们刚才说到哪儿了？”这样用三个词表达简单明了有木有！

如果后面跟上了具体的时间点，才是真的在问“我们在哪儿”。比如：Where were weat 10:00? 我们10点钟的时候在哪儿呢？
