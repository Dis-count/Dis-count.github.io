Many words in English are formed from the same root or base word. By adding different suffixes, a range of new words can be formed.

A suffix is a letter or a group of letters that are added to the end of a word to make a new word. Generally, suffixes have a particular meaning. When a suffix is added to a base word and that base word becomes a noun, it is called a noun suffix.

Here are some rules:
- Adding a suffix usually changes the class of the word (for example, verb to noun).

For example:

Root/Base word: Entertain (verb)

Suffix: -ment

New word: Entertainment (noun)
- Adding a suffix can mean the class of the word remains the same but the meaning of the new word changes.

For example:

Root/Base word: quest (noun)

Suffix: -ion

New word: question (noun)
- Adding a suffix can cause a spelling change.

For example:

Root/Base word: supervise

Suffix: -or

New word: supervisor
