Summary about the engineering statistic.

1. GLM. *2
You should know the difference between logit and probit regression.
Why this model use the normal distribution as the link function.

EM algorithm-- How to obtain the Q function.(log likelihood function)

2. Quantile Regression
Strat from the median, which is the 50% quantile regression.
You should know the background of quantile, then you can know what this
regression is used for.

3. Bivariate normal distribution.
How to find the CI about $\theta = \mu_1/\mu_2$ 

4. Cauchy distribution has the same confidence interval.
